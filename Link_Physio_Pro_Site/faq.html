                    <h3>Do I need a physician referral?</h3>
                    <p>Nope! In Florida, you can start physical therapy without a referral. Just reach out to Link Physio and we can get you booked for your first session.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Do you take insurance?</h3>
                    <p>We keep things simple—Link Physio is completely cash-based. That means no surprise bills, no insurance restrictions, and no complicated paperwork. You pay at the time of your visit and know exactly what you’re getting.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Where do sessions take place?</h3>
                    <p>All visits are by appointment only at Ripple Co-Working in Daytona Beach. It’s a comfortable, private space.</p>

                    <h3>What happens at my first visit?</h3>
                    <p>We’ll start with a conversation about your goals, history, and current concerns, followed by a full assessment. From there, we’ll jump right into your first treatment so you leave already feeling progress. Wear something comfortable and bring along any medical info you think might help.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What conditions do you treat?</h3>
                    <p>From low back and neck pain to sports injuries, headaches, tendonitis, and vertigo, we treat a wide range of aches, pains, and movement issues. You can check out the <a href="services.html">Services</a> page for the full list.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How do I schedule?</h3>
                    <p>Easy—call, email, or use the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page to request your appointment. If you're not sure if it's a right fit, still feel free to reach out and we can discuss!</p>
