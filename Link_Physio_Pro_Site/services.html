        <h3>What to expect at Link Physio</h3>
        <p>

            Every visit begins with a comprehensive Initial Evaluation, where we review your medical history, movement
            goals, and any current limitations. From there, we conduct a detailed Assessment of your strength, mobility,
            and pain patterns to identify the root cause of your symptoms.

            We’ll then walk you through a personalized Discussion & Plan—a tailored strategy focused on relieving pain
            and restoring function. Your Treatment & Follow-Up sessions may include hands-on techniques designed to
            reduce pain, release tension, improve tissue mobility, and get you back to moving confidently. You'll also
            receive clear education and ongoing progress tracking to support long-term results.
        <h3>Ongoing Support</h3>
        <p>We aim to get you independent fast—but we’re always here when needed.</p>
